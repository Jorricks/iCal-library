# Timezone components
These are the components that are related to TimeZone information. You generally don't use these directly but let iCal-Reader use it when there is a TZID parameter set for a property.

The [DayLight](ical_library.ical_components.DayLight) and [Standard](ical_library.ical_components.Standard) class both extend the [_TimeOffsetPeriod](ical_library.ical_components.v_timezone._TimeOffsetPeriod).

::: ical_library.ical_components.v_timezone._TimeOffsetPeriod

::: ical_library.ical_components.DayLight

::: ical_library.ical_components.Standard
