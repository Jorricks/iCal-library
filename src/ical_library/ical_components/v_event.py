class VEvent(AbstractComponentWithRecurringProperties):

    This class represents the VEVENT component specified in RFC 5545 in '3.6.1. Event Component'.

    A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of component properties, possibly including "VALARM" calendar
    components, that represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. For example, it can be an activity; such as
    a one-hour long, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow. Generally, an event will take up time on an
    individual calendar. Hence, the event will appear as an opaque interval in a search for busy time. Alternately,
    the event can have its Time Transparency set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent blocking of the event in
    searches for busy time.

    :param name: The actual name of this component instance. E.g. VEVENT, RRULE, VCUSTOMCOMPONENT.
    :param parent: The Component this item is encapsulated by in the iCalendar data file.
